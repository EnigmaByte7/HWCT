If you are carrying over the work please check out the below details before you begin ::

* This link https://www.figma.com/file/mL8zjciWqcdKwDdA24MoZM/NGO?type=design&node-id=193-820&mode=design&t=5gKHfhxwYsXaRaNi-0 contains the website designs you need to work upon.
* 5 out of 10 pages are completed except for some linking and small changes. These pages are Homepage, Donation page, Virtual Adoption, Gallery and Donation Ahead.
* Here are the links to these pages :
  [hwct.vercel.app](https://hwct.vercel.app/)
  [hwct.vercel.app/](https://hwct.vercel.app/donation.html)
  https://hwct.vercel.app/donation_ahead.html
  https://hwct.vercel.app/gallery.html
  https://hwct.vercel.app/vdonation.html
  You can take inspiration form here to continue with other pages.

* Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the pages, the animations are done using GSAP animaitons, if you are new to gsap, consider this tutorial https://gsap.com/resources/get-started.
  Or see any of the js files in the repo, to get an idea. Try to keep the animations simple to suite the theme of website, simple animations may include blur effects, fade-in, swipe left     or right or maybe anything you like.

## Pending stuff
Some small details are incomplete and may need your attention ::

* The footer is incomplete and is merely an image of the intended design, kindly complete it, if you find it very complex in design, feel free to make a simlper yet effective footer in place, though keep it the same in every page.
* Little tweaks may be required in the mobile UI.
* A seperate navbar for mobile displays, A hamburger menu (side drawer)  may be a nice option for this.

##That's all ! Best of Luck ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³, Happy Coding !
